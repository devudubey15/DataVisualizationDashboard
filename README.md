## Overview

The Data Visualization Dashboard is a powerful tool for businesses and organizations to gain insights from their data. It offers a user-friendly interface to interact with data and generate visualizations dynamically.

## Why Do We Need This?

- **Data Analysis**: Allows users to analyze large datasets easily and identify patterns or trends.
- **Decision Making**: Provides valuable insights for making informed decisions based on data-driven evidence.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the process of data visualization and analysis, saving time and resources.
- **Customization**: Users can customize filters and parameters to focus on specific aspects of the data.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages various libraries such as Chart.js and React-Chartjs-2 for data visualization. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend server.

### Frontend Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs.
- **React-Chartjs-2**: A React wrapper for Chart.js to integrate charts seamlessly into React applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend server.

## Backend

### Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend server.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing the application's data.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for schema-based modeling of application data.
- **Cors**: Middleware for Express.js to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for handling requests from the frontend.

### Database

MongoDB is utilized as the database for storing insights, which can be queried and retrieved based on user-defined filters.

### Server

The Express.js server handles incoming requests from the frontend, processes them, interacts with the MongoDB database, and sends back the required data to the client.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend using npm or yarn.
3. Set up MongoDB and ensure it is running locally or on a remote server.
4. Configure environment variables for the backend server if necessary.
5. Start the backend server and frontend application.

## Usage

1. Access the application through the provided URL.
2. Use the filters on the dashboard to select specific regions, countries, sectors, or topics.
3. View the generated visualizations and insights based on the selected filters.
4. Interact with the charts and data to gain insights and make informed decisions.
